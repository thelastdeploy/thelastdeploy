First off — thank you for taking the time to contribute! 🎉

TLD is built in public and every contribution matters, whether it's fixing a typo, improving a lab, writing a new validator, or helping someone on Discord.

This guide explains how to get involved.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21+
- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.11+
- Docker 24+

### CLI (agent)

```bash
make build          # builds to ./bin/tld
make install        # builds + installs to /usr/local/bin
```

### Web backend

```bash
cd web/backend
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### Web frontend

```bash
cd web/frontend
npm install && npm run dev
```

### Landing page

```bash
cd landing
npm install && npm run dev    # http://localhost:3002
```

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. **Fork** the repository and create your branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/the-thing-you-fixed
   ```

2. **Make your changes.** Keep PRs focused — one concern per PR.

3. **Test your changes:**
   - For validators: run `tld check` against a passing and failing state
   - For the CLI: `make build && ./bin/tld <command>`
   - For the web: run the dev server and verify in browser
   - For the landing page: `npm run dev` in `/landing`

4. **Follow the [commit convention](#commit-convention).**

5. **Open a Pull Request** against `main` with:
   - A clear title (`feat: add nginx reverse proxy lab`)
   - What changed and why
   - Screenshots for UI changes
   - Steps to test (especially for validators)

6. A maintainer will review your PR. Please be responsive to feedback — PRs with no response for 14 days may be closed.

## Writing a Lab

Labs live in `challenges/<track>/sections/<section>/labs/<lab-id>/`.

### Lab directory structure

```
labs/
└── tld-<track>-short-name/       # e.g. dkr-fix-broken-container-network
    ├── README.md                  # Lab instructions shown to the learner
    └── validator.sh               # Automated checker
```

### README.md format

```markdown
# Lab Title

## Objective
One sentence describing the goal.

## Background
Brief context the learner needs.

## Your Task
Numbered steps or a clear problem statement.

## Hints
Optional — spoiler-tagged hints.

## Validation
Run `tld check` to verify your solution.
```

### Naming conventions

- Lab IDs use the track prefix: `lnx-` (Linux), `dkr-` (Docker), `git-` (Git), `k8s-` (Kubernetes)
- Use kebab-case: `dkr-fix-broken-dockerfile`
- Keep names short but descriptive

---

## Writing a Validator

Validators are `validator.sh` bash scripts that exit `0` on pass and non-zero on fail.

### Rules

- **Be specific** — test exactly what the lab asks for, not a workaround
- **Be fast** — validators should complete in < 5 seconds
- **Be informative** — print clear pass/fail messages with `echo`
- **Be portable** — assume a standard Linux environment (Ubuntu/Debian)
- **Do not install anything** — validators must not modify the system

### Template

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

PASS=0
FAIL=0

check() {
  local description="$1"
  local result="$2"   # 0 = pass, 1 = fail

  if [ "$result" -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "✓ $description"
    PASS=$((PASS + 1))
  else
    echo "✗ $description"
    FAIL=$((FAIL + 1))
  fi
}

# --- Your checks below ---

# Example: check nginx is running
nginx_running=0
systemctl is-active --quiet nginx 2>/dev/null || nginx_running=1
check "nginx service is running" "$nginx_running"

# --- Summary ---
echo ""
echo "Results: $PASS passed, $FAIL failed"

[ "$FAIL" -eq 0 ] && exit 0 || exit 1
```

---

## Commit Convention

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>(<scope>): <short description>

[optional body]
```

| Type | When to use |
|------|------------|
| `feat` | New lab, new feature, new validator |
| `fix` | Bug fix in validator, CLI, or UI |
| `docs` | Documentation only |
| `chore` | Build scripts, deps, CI |
| `refactor` | Code change with no behaviour change |
| `style` | Formatting, CSS, whitespace |
| `test` | Adding or improving tests |

**Examples:**
```
feat(challenges): add dkr-fix-broken-container-network lab
fix(validator): correct nginx port check in linux-networking
docs: update contributing guide with validator template
chore(deps): bump next to 16.2.6
```
