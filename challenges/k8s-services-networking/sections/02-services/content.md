# Kubernetes Services & ClusterIP

A **Service** is an abstract way to expose an application running on a set of Pods as a network service. With Kubernetes, you don't need to modify your application to use an unfamiliar service discovery mechanism. Kubernetes gives Pods their own IP addresses and a single DNS name for a set of Pods, and can load-balance across them.

## Service Types

Kubernetes supports four main types of Services:
1. **ClusterIP (Default)**: Exposes the Service on a cluster-internal IP. Choosing this value makes the Service only reachable from within the cluster.
2. **NodePort**: Exposes the Service on each Node's IP at a static port (the `NodePort`). You can contact the NodePort Service from outside the cluster by requesting `<NodeIP>:<NodePort>`.
3. **LoadBalancer**: Exposes the Service externally using a cloud provider's load balancer.
4. **ExternalName**: Maps the Service to the contents of the `externalName` field (e.g. `foo.bar.example.com`).

## Defining a ClusterIP Service

Here is a standard YAML manifest for a ClusterIP Service:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 9376
```

- **`spec.selector`**: Identifies the target Pods by matching their labels (in this case, Pods with `app: my-app`).
- **`spec.ports[].port`**: The port that the Service itself will expose inside the cluster.
- **`spec.ports[].targetPort`**: The port on the container inside the target Pod that receives the traffic.
