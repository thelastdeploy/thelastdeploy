# Troubleshooting Service Connectivity

When a service is unreachable in Kubernetes, the issue typically resides in one of three areas: selector mismatches, port mismatches, or pod startup failures.

---

## 1. Verify Selector Matches Pod Labels

If the Service selector does not match the Pod labels, the Service will not route traffic because no endpoints will be created.

**How to verify:**
```bash
kubectl get endpoints <service-name>
```

If the `ENDPOINTS` column is `<none>` or empty, verify the selector using:
```bash
kubectl describe service <service-name>
```

And compare it with the actual labels on the Pod:
```bash
kubectl get pods --show-labels
```

---

## 2. Check Port and TargetPort Alignment

- **`port`**: The port clients use to access the service.
- **`targetPort`**: The port that the container inside the Pod listens on. If this is misconfigured (e.g. your app container listens on `8080` but `targetPort` is set to `80`), connections will fail.

**How to verify:**
Inspect the Pod definition or deployment manifest to confirm which port the container is actually exposing:
```bash
kubectl get pod <pod-name> -o yaml | grep containerPort
```

---

## 3. Verify Pod Health

A Service will only route traffic to Pods that are in the **`Ready`** state. If the Pod has crashed, is in `CrashLoopBackOff`, or has failed its readiness probe, the IP of the Pod is removed from the service endpoints.

**How to verify:**
```bash
kubectl get pods
```
Check if the `READY` column shows `0/1` or similar. If so, investigate pod conditions or readiness probes using `kubectl describe pod`.
