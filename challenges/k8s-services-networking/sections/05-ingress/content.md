# Routing Traffic with Ingress

While `NodePort` exposes services externally, it has major limitations:
- You must manage custom non-standard ports (`30000-32767`).
- Each service requires its own NodePort.
- There is no support for hostname-based routing (e.g. `app.example.com` vs `api.example.com`) or SSL/TLS termination on standard HTTP/HTTPS ports (80/443).

**Ingress** solves these problems.

## What is Ingress?

An **Ingress** is an API object that manages external access to the services in a cluster, typically HTTP. It can provide load balancing, SSL termination, and name-based virtual hosting.

To make Ingress resources work, the cluster must have an **Ingress Controller** running. Unlike other controllers (like the replicaset controller), which run as part of the `kube-controller-manager` binary, Ingress Controllers are not started automatically with a cluster and must be installed separately.

Popular ingress controllers include:
- `ingress-nginx` (community-maintained Nginx-based)
- Traefik
- HAProxy
- Kong

## Defining an Ingress Resource

An Ingress resource defines the routing rules:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: minimal-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  rules:
  - host: app.local
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: backend-service
            port:
              number: 80
```

- **`ingressClassName`**: Tells the cluster which Ingress Controller should handle this Ingress resource (usually `nginx`).
- **`host`**: The domain name to map.
- **`backend.service`**: The destination Service and Port.
