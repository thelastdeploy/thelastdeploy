# Understanding Linux File Permissions & Incident Context

Before diagnosing the outage, let's review how **Linux File Permissions** work and why they cause application crashes when misconfigured.

## 🔐 1. The Linux Permission Model

Every file and directory in Linux has an owner, a group, and a set of permission bits for three categories of users:

| Category | Abbreviation | Description |
|---|:---:|---|
| **User (Owner)** | **u** | The specific system user account that owns the file. |
| **Group** | **g** | Users belonging to the group that owns the file. |
| **Others** | **o** | Every other user account on the Linux system. |

## 📜 2. Permission Types & Octal Values

Permissions are represented using symbolic characters (`r`, `w`, `x`) or 3-digit octal numbers (`4`, `2`, `1`):

| Bit | Character | Numeric Value | Meaning on Files | Meaning on Directories |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Read** | `r` | **4** | View/read file content | List files in directory |
| **Write** | `w` | **2**  | Modify/delete file content | Create/remove files in directory |
| **Execute** | `x` | **1** | Run file as program/script | Enter directory (`cd`) |

### Standard Octal Permission Examples:
- **644**: Owner can read & write; group and others can only read. Standard for public files & logs.
- **755**: Owner can read, write & execute; others can read & execute. Standard for scripts & directories.
- **600**: Only owner can read & write. Standard for private keys & passwords.
- **000**: **NO ACCESS FOR ANYONE** (except `root`). Any non-root account receives `Permission denied`.

## ⚙️ 3. How Background Daemons Access Files

When system services run under **systemd**, they run under a designated non-root user (e.g. `webapp`):



When `webapp` starts:
1. The kernel checks if user `webapp` has read (`r`) or write (`w`) permissions on `/var/log/webapp/app.log`.
2. If `webapp` has no permissions (`000`), the system call `open()` fails instantly with:
   `Permission denied` (`EACCES`)
3. The application process aborts and crashes on startup.

## 💡 Essential Inspection Commands

When investigating permission issues, use these commands:

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ls -l /var/log/app-server.log` | Display file permissions, owner, and group |
| `stat -c "%a %U:%G" /var/log/app-server.log` | Print octal mode (`644`) and owner/group (`root:root`) |
| `id webapp` | Inspect groups and UID of the application user |
