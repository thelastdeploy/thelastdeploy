# Resource Lifecycle

By default, when a resource modification requires recreating it, Terraform destroys the old resource first, then creates the new one. You can customize this behavior using the `lifecycle` block.

## Lifecycle Rules:
1. **`create_before_destroy = true`:** Creates the new resource first, then destroys the old one. Useful for zero-downtime upgrades.
2. **`prevent_destroy = true`:** Prevents Terraform from destroying a resource (rejects the apply if a destroy is required). Excellent for protecting production databases.
3. **`ignore_changes = [...]`:** Ignores changes to specific resource attributes configured outside of Terraform.
